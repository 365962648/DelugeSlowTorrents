# DelugeSlowTorrents
Automatically delete slow torrents in deluge!

I left the code easily modifiable, I also capture most of the deluge-console info output and parsed it into a hash structure for future projects.

**$average** is in MiB/s

**$time** is in minutes.

You'll need to change both of those. Also, you will need to change the connect strings to suit your environment.
